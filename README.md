## Introduction
The wrapper's main purpose is to provide a simple solution to fetch data from IGDB's database using PHP.

To have access to IGDB's database you have to register a Twitch Account and have your own `client_id` and `access_token`. Refer to the [Account Creation](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation) and [Authentication](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#authentication) sections of the [IGDB API Documentation](https://api-docs.igdb.com/) for details.

> Now there is a utility class called `IGDBUtils` which contains an `authenticate` method to help you generate your access token! Refer to the [documentation](#documentation) for details!

For a better understanding of the wrapper, there are several example scripts in the [documentation](#documentation).
